My experience with STEM is really great,before STEM I had a very small idea about creating a website now I can create my own website,at first it will seem hard but when you see the results you will feel great .STEM program doesn't stop here it also help you to make new friends and know new people . I'm really proud that I took this experience and I think that you should try it too.
